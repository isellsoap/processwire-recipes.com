# ProcessWire Recipes

## About this project

PWR aims to supply short and concise instructions and snippets on how to solve particular problems or realize particular features in ProcessWire. 

**tl;dr: Contribute to this repository consisting of recipe text files: [https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes)**

Recipes are structured as follows:
 
 * Description of the problem
 * Description and code sample of the chosen solution
 * (optional) Used or referred resources for problem solving
 * Tags assigned in order to structure the directory processwire-recipes.com and increase searchability
 
Additional to this core data, ProcessWire Recipes need the following indications
 
 * Author(s) of the recipe
 * Its version (when being updated or modified)
 
## How to contribute

You can contribute to PWR by adding text files to a separate repository (this is made possible with [ProcessRecipeInstaller](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/ProcessRecipeInstaller)). **Alternatively, for the time being, you can post your recipes in this [Topic in the forums](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/7572-processwire-recipes/?hl=recipes) and we'll add it to the repo**. In the near future we plan to implement a contribution form right here to sync back to the GitHub repo.

Necessary steps:

 * Fork **[the recipe repo](https://github.com/processwire-recipes/Recipes)** on GitHub
 * Clone to your local environment, check out `master` branch
 * Create a branch for your contribution(s), please use a descriptive name
 * Add your recipes text file(s)
     * **Before you tag your recipe(s), have a look into the tag list and try to prevent close-to-identical doublets**
     * When in doubt, use singular
 * Commit, push to GitHub
 * Create a pull request ([Info](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/))
