# ProcessWire Recipes

## About this project

PWR aims to supply short and concise instructions and snippets on how to solve particular problems or realize particular features in ProcessWire. 

**tl;dr: Contribute via adding recipes to `/site/recipe-txt-files`**

Recipes are structured as follows:
 
 * Description of the problem
 * Description and code sample of the chosen solution
 * (optional) Used or referred resources for problem solving
 
Additional to this core data, ProcessWire Recipes need the following indications
 
 * Author(s) of the recipe
 * Its version
 * Tags applying in order to structure the directory processwire-recipes.com and increase searchability
