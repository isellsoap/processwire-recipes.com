title: Enhance image links on your site with FancyBox
----
version: 0.0.1
----
authors: Martijn Geerts
----
tags: modal, javascript, fancybox
----
problem:
You have got thumbnails in your body fields that link to larger versions of the image, but you want to avoid setting a class on each on them manually (or confront your customer with the Rich Text Editors settings window).
----
solution:
Find all links to image files (jpg, png, gif) that originate in the particular ProcessWire installation.
```
$("[href^='/site/assets/files/']").filter(function() {
    return this.href.match(/.*[jpg|png|gif]$/i);
}).addClass('to-fancy');
```

Init fancybox on this selection. You can supply an options object.
```
$('.to-fancy').fancybox();
```
